        <h1>&lt;Programming experience/&gt;</h1>
        <p>
            I have some experience with HTML and CSS.<br/>
            I taught myself how to do it through freecodecamp and by watching YouTube videos.<br/>
            While learning about html and CSS I learned about flexbox I found it verry useful and started using it for my projects, I also used it to make this website.<br/>
            I have made some small project to practice my html and CSS.<br/>
            This is a practice project where I create a website to promote a DJ's brand and music.<br/>
            I have been working on this project for some time now, but I have also learned many new things through it.
