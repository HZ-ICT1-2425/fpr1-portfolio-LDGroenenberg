        <h1>&lt;Why i chose for HBO-ICT/&gt;</h1>
        <p>before I signed up for this study I worked 3 years at a elementary school.<br/>
            I started to lose interest in the job and didn't got the fun out of it as when I started working.<br/>
            In the mean time I started to pick up coding and got more ICT tasks at my work.<br/>
            I started with simply copying code and try to edit it to what I wanted it to do,<br/>
            but soon after I started learning html and CSS and made some simple websites.<br/>
            I also found work more fun again by doing some ICT tasks but it just wasn't it.<br/>
            For some time I was looking to start a new study, and I just made the decision and chose for HBO ICT.</p>
